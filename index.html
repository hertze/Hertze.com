<h1>About Joakim Hertze</h1>
	<p>I&#8217;m a psychiatrist with a keen interest in conditions affecting cognition. I also conduct scientific research at the Department of Memory Research in Malm√∂, where I look for better ways of diagnosing Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>

		<p>I live in southern Sweden with my wife, two children and a cat. In my spare time I write and publish the website <a href="http://swedishpixels.com">Swedish Pixels</a>, run and dream of <em>completing</em> a novel.</p>
